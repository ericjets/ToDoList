# ToDoList

This web application is a simple to do list! Thats it.

I am sure if you are here, you have probably created your own to-do list throughout your journey in Software Development.
In fact this is my third to-do list I have created in my career, but what makes this one stand out to me is that I plan to
continue to develop this application as my skills increase with Web Development. Also this is the first one I have attempted
without following along a tutorial, just relying on the concepts that I have learned and being able to apply them. I figured
I might as well upload this to Github just to track my progress and possibly get feature requests from the open source community
as well as input as to where I can improve the program (also I figured this would be a good easy way to improve my Git and
Github knowledge).

So lets get into the nitty gritty, shall we!

What does it do?

- It allows a user to track the list of tasks they would like to keep track of
- Once a task is completed, the user can go back and mark it as such. Giving the user the visual reward of marking something off.
- The user is also able to completely reset their list of tasks so that they can start a new list with all new tasks.

Technology Used?

- HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, SCSS

See the updates folder, to see the new features added from version to version.

I hope you enjoy the program and as always,

HAPPY CODING

- Eric
